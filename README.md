# Advent of Code 2022

In ASCII Art Format

This is a repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

This year, I'm going to try to solve the challenges in [ASCII Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) format. Why? Because I can.

This site will act as an interactive story, capable of running the code for each day's challenge. While providing context in the form of ASCII Art.
